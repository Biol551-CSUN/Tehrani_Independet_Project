# Tehrani_Independet_Project
**Purpuse of my Independent Project**


*This coding project's purpose is to create a machine learning model that can predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties. The "Wine Quality" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used in this experiment. Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model development and evaluation, and display of the results are all part of the project. This project relies heavily on tidyverse, randomForest, ggplot2, corrplot, gganimate, cowplot, and GGally libraries. This project's end result is a predictive model that may be used to classify the quality of new wines based on their chemical properties.*
